  <img src="GypsyGirlz.jpg" alt="gypsygirl">
  <p>Gypsy Girl  (a copy of Frans Hals' famous painting The Gipsy Girl which can be seen to the right of it and which was painted in 1629)
<br>Unfortunately it looks like Alex's Gypsy Girl has been in a mud-wrestling match due to the mould that has grown on the painting.<br>This painting
needs restoring.  I find that this is one of Alex's more interesting paintings as it shows one of his artistic influences
<br>and that he had some admiration for the Dutch Golden Age portrait artists.  Hals was a contemporary of Rembrandt's.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  
<img src="Josephine.jpg" alt="Josephine">
  <p>Portrait of Josephine (wife of Napoleon). 
The story is that Alex used his wife as the model for the body and painted Josephine's head on top.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  
  <img src="Ladies-letter-rz.jpg" alt="LadiesLetter">
  <p>Two Ladies Reading A Letter (This is said to be a copy of a post-card of the times.)<br>
  This is an interesting painting because it shows how Huston was borrowing from Dutch painters in the Golden Age of Dutch Painting, who in turn were influenced by Japanese woodblock prints.<br>

  <img src="japonisme.jpg" alt="japonsime">
  <p>"Two women reading a letter" by Kikugawa Eizan, "Sisters Reading a Book" by Dutch Golden Age of Danish Painting member Constantin Hansen and "Illicit Letter" by Italian Roccoco artist Vittorio Reggianini<br>
  When Japan reopened their trading ports with the West in 1854, Japanese art objects flooded into Europe.  From the 1860s, ukiyo-e, Japanese woodblock prints, became a source of inspiration for many Western artists. Although the prints were sold domestically in Japan, Dutch merchants brought them to the west where they created a big impression on artists throughout Europe.  The french coined the term "Japonisme" referring to the influence of Japanese art on Western art. Woodcuts, screens and porcelain flooded initially into France and the Netherlands. During the 1860s, these items, particularly the woodcuts, became a source of inspiration to many European Impressionist and post-Impressionist artists.<br>So here we can see an example of Japonsime travelling from  its source in Japan, then to Holland, then to Italy and thence to Ontario, Canada.</p>
