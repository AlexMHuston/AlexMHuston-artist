<h1>Robert</h1> 
<p>Alex's eldest son , Robert Wiley Huston, died in 1919 at age 13 from Endocarditis (inflammation of the heart) which developed as a complication from having his tonsils removed in a time when antibiotics had yet to be invented (*It was not until 1928 that penicillin, the first true antibiotic, was discovered by Alexander Fleming).  According to his sister Margaret, Robbie kept occupied as he lay in his bed for weeks slowly fading away by making magazine bead necklaces.  Ladies in his neighbourhood and family members brought Robert fashion magazines that had colourful glossy advertisements in them.  He would then cut the coloured pieces of the adverts into strips, and then roll the strips tightly into rolls which were then shellacked, forming colourful and shiny "magazine beads". These were strung into necklaces.  He would then sell the magazine bead necklaces to the ladies and earned a tidy sum of cash. He was very interested in Astronomy. He died at age thirteen on December 16th, 1919 at the family home at 59 St. Clair Ave. East in Toronto. His body was then transported by train to Orangeville and buried.

<h1>William</h1> 
<p>Six years later in 1925 the youngest son, William, died from Tetanus (Lockjaw) which developed from a serious wound inflicted by the kick of a horse.  The horse belonged to the school he attended called St. Andrew's College.  It was his favorite horse and was called "Princess".  On Tuesday the 12th of May 2025, he was riding Princess in Leaside which was mostly undeveloped land at the time.  He got off the horse to fix his leggings and then prepared to get back on by placing one foot into the stirrup.  At that moment a twig snapped under his other foot.  The noise spooked the horse and it reared up and struck his thigh with its hoof causing a deep laceration and knocking him to the ground.  He walked over a mile to the junction of Bavview and Millwood with the gaping wound.  At that location he was spotted by Mr. A.W. Sutherland who took him in his car to Yongue Street.  Sutherland stopped there to pick up Police Sergeant Davis and then proceeded to the police station.  Sutherland recalled that William stated, "It wasn't the horses fault." At the police station Dr. Hugh A. Elliott attended to the "gaping wound in the lad's thigh."  William was then taken to the Toronto General Hospital where his thigh was operated on. After the operation he asked, "I will be able to ride again, won't I doctor?"  He was released in the evening and went home.  Although the Tetanus vaccine was not yet commercially available until 1940, a "passive tetanus antitoxin" had been distributed to civilian hospitals in the early 1920's.  Unfortunately Robbie's family physician (Dr. Snelgrove) assumed that the hospital had administered the antitoxin and the hospital assumed Dr. Snelgrove had administered it.  Neither had.  Consequently Robbie contracted Tetanus and died painfully from muscle spasms and asphyxiation exactly a week after the incident on Tuesday May 19th, 1925, age fourteen.  The following day his photo was on the front page of the Toronto Star Newspaper.</p><br>

<p>Below is some more info on the boys and their deaths, and also some interesting background and historical information on the house in Toronto where William, Robert and Margaret lived with their parents.  It was also the house where both William and Robert's funerals were held: 59 St. Clair Avenue East, Toronto.</p><br>

<h1>59 St. Clair Avenue East, Toronto</h1>
<p>When William (Bud) Huston died from lockjaw, the family had his funeral at their home at 59 St. Clair Ave. E. in Toronto as they had done six years earlier with their son Robert.  The 1925 city directories and assessment rolls listed the property as a single-family home in Toronto's Yonge - St. Clair neighborhood (then part of the upscale Deer Park area, with owners such as local professionals or merchants). In 1925 it had an assessed value around $5,000–$7,000 Canadian Dollars and was located on the south side of the street.  By 1948 Canadian Federal land acquisition for Postal Station Q began, with the bulk of land parcels finalized by late 1949. Post-WWII federal expansion required dedicated urban sites for postal and administrative functions amid Toronto's booming population (from ~650,000 in 1941 to over 1 million by 1951). The Deer Park location was selected for its proximity to Yonge Street rail lines and the downtown area.  The land aquisition process involved negotiated purchases from private owners where possible (e.g., for 59 St. Clair, the transaction closed on October 17, 1949, for approximately $12,500 CAD. For holdouts some properties were expropriated under the federal Expropriation Act, though 59 St. Clair was acquired amicably.  Demolition of the acquired residences occurred in early 1950, followed by groundbreaking for the 10-storey Postal Station Q in mid-1950. The main western building (25 St. Clair Ave E) opened in 1951–1952 as a postal sorting facility. The eastern extension (incorporating the former 59 St. Clair site) was added in 1956–1957 to expand office space, fully integrating the parcel into federal operations.  In later decades the postal facility was converted into an office building for government workers and named the Arthur Meighen Building.

<p>Today there is nothing left of number 59.  The Arthur Meighen Building (designated 25 St. Clair Ave. E.) has 1500 Federal Employees of the CRA, Border Services and Immigration Agencies working there. But who was Arthur Meighen?  Well, let's jump back into our time machine to a time when all the Hustons were living on St. Clair Avenue.  Arthur Meighen was a name they would be familiar with.</p><br>   
<img src="Former_PM_Arthur_Meighen.jpg" alt="ArthurMeighen">
<p>Arthur Meighen was the ninth Prime Minister of Canada who held the office between 1920 and 1921.  Meighen was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada and was remembered for subduing the Winipeg General Strike which paralyzed the railways in Canada.  He also was responsible for implementing mandatory military service for World War I. In January of 1918 the Military Service Act was put into place. It was very unpopular with Canadians, so much so, that when it caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service 385,510 sought exemption.  In Quebec there was rioting which resulted in the conscription office being ransacked.  Soldiers were brought in and fired on the crowd killing five and injuring many more. </p><br>

<p>Arthur Meighen was the leader of the opposition while the Huston's lived at 59 St. Clair Ave. E. in Toronto with his family.  Meighen and the Tories won a plurality of seats in the inconclusive election of 1925 (the year William Huston died). William Lyon Mackenzie King was already the sitting prime minister and opted to retain confidence in the house through an informal alliance with the Progressives. Meighen denounced King as holding onto office like a "lobster with lockjaw."</p>
<br>
<p>Many years after William Huston died from lockjaw, a federal government building named after Arthur Meighen was erected on the site of William Huston's home address, 59 St. Clair Ave. E.</p>
