  <p>Harvest.<br>
  Alex Huston borrowed the harvest portion from George Vicat Cole's painting titled "At Arundel, Sussex" and modified it in several ways including removing the tree with yellow/green foliage in the foreground and placing it in the background. George Vicat Cole (1833-1893) was an English painter who was known for his landscape paintings.  See Cole's painting below...

  <p>A Dutch Scene. (copied from a postcard)<br>Interestingly it appears that Alex Huston was a big fan of the Hague School, which was a group of artists who lived and worked in The Hague, Netherlands between 1860 and 1890 and were dedicated to Realism and landscapes. This Dutch scene painted by Huston is an amalgam of two paintings by Hague School artist Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch (1824-1903) depicting the Trekvliet Canal which linked The Hague with the neighboring villages of Rijswijk and Voorburg.  The paintings, like most of the Hague School, emphasize atmospheric landscapes.  Playfully, Huston reversed Shipping Canal and added a footbridge.  Then he added the rowboat from Mill in the Polder to create an amalgam of Weissenbruch's two works.<br>
